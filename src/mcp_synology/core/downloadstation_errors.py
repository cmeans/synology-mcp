"""Download Station API error codes (400-series, DS-specific semantics).

DS overloads the same numeric range that FILESTATION_ERROR_CODES uses, with
different meanings (e.g., DS 400 = file upload failed; FS 400 = invalid
parameter). Keeping the maps in separate files makes the overlap visible.

To add a new code: add an entry below AND ensure docs/error-codes.md has a
matching section (the tests/core/test_help_urls.py test enforces parity).
